## Issues

### Basics
- Since no one owns, some interest groups's policies conflict.
- The Internet forces information overload. We do not know what to believe.

### Commerce
- Businesses monitor our shopping behavior on their website and use that data for advertising products to us, which are often annoying to users.
- On top of that, some businesses may misuse our personal information for different purposes, which I think is unethical.

### Privacy
- Surveillance system.
- Personal data leaking.

### Risks
- One person leaking top-secret information, can damage the nation's diplomacy and national security.
- If someone steals my UDC student ID, the thief will be able to misuse my identity for purchasing UDC services.

### Intellectual Property
- A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (2001)
- People do not honor intellectual property laws seriously, copying and sharing from the Internet and disregard the existence of copyright.

### Computer Abuse
- Hacking to harm or threaten others.
- Spreading malware.

### Social
- Offshoring. Remotely hiring workers from overseas for cheaper wages.
- Workers surfing the Internet during their work time.

### Speech Issues
- Lack of netiquette may cause misunderstanding.
- Some people make hate speech taking advantage of anonymity.
