- [Understanding Photographic Copyright](http://www.ppa.com/content.cfm?ItemNumber=1720) (PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS OF AMERICA)
    + Copyright is a property right.
    + Just because you buy a print does not mean you have purchased the copyright.
    + Professional photographers are the smallest of small copyright holders.
    Under the Federal Copyright Act of 1976, photographs are protected by copyright from the moment of creation.
    + Photographers have the exclusive right to reproduce their photographs (right to control the making of copies). Copyright
    + Unless you have permission from the photographer, you can’t copy, distribute (no scanning and sending them to others), publicly display (no putting them online), or create derivative works from photographs.
    + A photographer can easily create over 20,000 separate pieces of intellectual property annually.
    + Professional photographers are dependent on their ability to control the reproduction of the photographs they create.
    + It affects their income and the livelihood of their families.
    + Even small levels of infringement—copying a photo without permission—can have a devastating impact on a photographer’s ability to make a living.
    + Copyright infringements—reproducing photos without permission—can result in civil and criminal penalties.

    + Under U.S. copyright law, the original owner of a created work is exclusively the creator, unless it’s a ‘work for hire’. In the wedding scenario, a photographer is hardly ever ‘for hire,’ and so we end up with the typical Nuptials situation. Even though married couples spend thousands for a photographer to cast their most memorable moments in just the right light, they may never actually own the results.
    + The copyright owner of wedding photos is the wedding photographer.
    + Most often, the photographer exercises this right fully, charging a hefty fee for reproductions, usually burned onto a DVD and sold to the couple. Many photographers, though they absolutely could, would never sell or transfer their copyright to anyone else due to the highly lucrative nature of such rights.
