If health care is a negative right, then the state has an obligation to keep people from preventing me from getting health care and discriminating against me. If health care’s a positive right, then the state has an obligation to provide it for me.

#### Negative rights (liberties)
- The right to act without *interference*
- Rights to act without interference
- A right for me to be protected from harm if I try to get something for myself
- Require the government to refrain from acting in certain ways; governments can respect individuals' negative rights simply by doing nothing at all.
- e.g., The rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” described in the U.S. Declaration of Independence are liberties, or negative rights. Freedom of speech and religion, as guaranteed in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, are negative rights: the government may not interfere with you, jail you, or kill you because of what you say or what your religious beliefs are.

####  Positive rights (claim-rights)
- An *obligation* of some people to provide certain things for others
- Impose an obligation on some people to provide certain things for others
- My right to have something provided for me
- Require the government to act in certain ways
