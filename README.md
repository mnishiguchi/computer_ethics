## Issues in computing

### Basics
- Since no one owns, some interest groups's policies conflict.
- The Internet forces information overload. We do not know what to believe.

### Commerce
- Businesses monitor our shopping behavior on their website and use that data for advertising products to us, which are often annoying to users.
- On top of that, some businesses may misuse our personal information for different purposes, which I think is unethical.

### Privacy
- Surveillance system.
- Personal data leaking.

### Risks
- One person leaking top-secret information, can damage the nation's diplomacy and national security.
- If someone steals my UDC student ID, the thief will be able to misuse my identity for purchasing UDC services.

### Intellectual Property
- A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (2001)
- People do not honor intellectual property laws seriously, copying and sharing from the Internet and disregard the existence of copyright.

### Computer Abuse
- Hacking to harm or threaten others.
- Spreading malware.

### Social
- Offshoring. Remotely hiring workers from overseas for cheaper wages.
- Workers surfing the Internet during their work time.

### Speech Issues
- Lack of netiquette may cause misunderstanding.
- Some people make hate speech taking advantage of anonymity.

## A variety of ethical views

Human behavior and real human situations are complex. There are often trade-offs to consider.
Ethical theories help to identify important principles or guidelines.

**Deontological theories**
-  the normative ethical position that judges the morality of an action based on the action's adherence to a rule or rules.

**Utilitarianism**
- the doctrine that actions are right if they are useful or for the benefit of a majority.

**natural rights**

**Positive rights (claim-rights)**
- An *obligation* of some people to provide certain things for others

**Golden rules**

**Contributing to society**

## How to decide what is ethical?

- Not all thoughtful people, or even all trained philosophers, will always come to the same conclusion as a result of an ethical analysis.
- Technological change in hardware and software proceeds at a very rapid pace, but theprinciples for deciding about the morality of what humans do have not changed over time
- Law - reactive rather than proactive
