## How to decide what is ethical?

- Not all thoughtful people, or even all trained philosophers, will always come to the same conclusion as a result of an ethical analysis. 
- Technological change in hardware and software proceeds at a very rapid pace, but theprinciples for deciding about the morality of what humans do have not changed over time
- Law - reactive rather than proactive

## Three approaches to ethical reasoning

- **Rights and duties**
    + Observing right of others and following duties imposed by rights

- **Utilitarianism**
    + Whether an act produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number

- **Fairness and justice**
    + Whether a society distributes benefits and burdens in a just manner

### Copyright
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright)
- [Understanding Photographic Copyright](http://www.ppa.com/content.cfm?ItemNumber=1720) (PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS OF AMERICA)
    + Copyright is a property right.
    + Just because you buy a print does not mean you have purchased the copyright.
    + Professional photographers are the smallest of small copyright holders.
    Under the Federal Copyright Act of 1976, photographs are protected by copyright from the moment of creation.
    + Photographers have the exclusive right to reproduce their photographs (right to control the making of copies). Copyright
    + Unless you have permission from the photographer, you can’t copy, distribute (no scanning and sending them to others), publicly display (no putting them online), or create derivative works from photographs.
    + A photographer can easily create over 20,000 separate pieces of intellectual property annually.
    + Professional photographers are dependent on their ability to control the reproduction of the photographs they create.
    + It affects their income and the livelihood of their families.
    + Even small levels of infringement—copying a photo without permission—can have a devastating impact on a photographer’s ability to make a living.
    + Copyright infringements—reproducing photos without permission—can result in civil and criminal penalties.

    + Under U.S. copyright law, the original owner of a created work is exclusively the creator, unless it’s a ‘work for hire’. In the wedding scenario, a photographer is hardly ever ‘for hire,’ and so we end up with the typical Nuptials situation. Even though married couples spend thousands for a photographer to cast their most memorable moments in just the right light, they may never actually own the results.
    + The copyright owner of wedding photos is the wedding photographer.
    + Most often, the photographer exercises this right fully, charging a hefty fee for reproductions, usually burned onto a DVD and sold to the couple. Many photographers, though they absolutely could, would never sell or transfer their copyright to anyone else due to the highly lucrative nature of such rights.

## [Re-identification](https://epic.org/privacy/reidentification/)

-  the process by which anonymized personal data is matched with its true owner. In order to protect the privacy interests of consumers, personal identifiers, such as name and social security number, are often removed from databases containing sensitive information.

- e.g., Search query data (p51)

    + Search engines collect many terabytes of data daily.
    + The companies analyze the data to improve search services, to target advertising better, and to develop new services.
    + By analyzing search queries, companies draw conclusions about what kinds of products and features people are looking for. They modify their products to meet consumer preferences.
    + In 2006, the federal government presented Google with a subpoena for two months of user search queries and all the Web addresses that Google indexes. Google protested, bringing the issue to public attention. Although the subpoena did not ask for names of users, the idea of the government gaining access to the details of people’s searches horrified privacy advocates and many people who use search engines. Google and privacy advocates opposed the precedent of government access to large masses of such data. A court reduced the scope of the subpoena, removing user queries.

- e.g., Smartphones (p53)
    - send location data to Google and Apple
    - sent age and gender in- formation to advertising companies
    - various apps copy the user’s contact list to remote servers
    - bank account numbers and security access codes in a hidden file on the user’s phone
    - **Some issues**:
        - Our contact lists and photos are ours; we should have control of them.
        - Law enforcement blindly relies on sometime flawed data.

- e.g., Data mining (p58)
    + searching and analyzing masses of data to find patterns and develop new information or knowledge.
    + e.g., research using social network data and smartphone data
- e.g., Opt in vs Opt out (p59)
- e.g., National ID system
