## p313 [Woman Sues Google for Bad Directions](http://www.pcworld.com/article/197618/Google_Maps_Error.html)

### 1.
I would allocate the percentage as follows:
    + Google: 0%
    + Ms. Rosenberg: 50%
    + The driver: 50%

The reason is because Google should not be blamed in this perticular case.
Ms. Rosenberg could have made her own judgement and have asked someone for further information. Problem is that she blindly relied on the GPS technology too much. I wonder why she did not plan ahead of time. At the same time, the driver should be blamed equally to Ms. Rosenberg because the driver could have avoided the accident if he or she was alert.

### 2.
No, it does not change my answer. Because I believe that the user of the technologies must be aware that all the decisions are theirs, especially in this case.

### 3.
I suppose that the author wanted to point out that this accident could have been avoided just by using common sense, not blindly believing whatever a Google application says.

## p314 Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) System

### 1.
I think that overall the emergency locator beacon technology is a good thing.
The reason is because, in case of accidents, with one of those devices rescue operations would be easier than without it. From a hiker's perspective, it would work as a life line that the hiker can fall back on in emergency.

### 2.
The authority should penalize false alarms and ensure that all the hikers understand that. Also the hikers should analyze potential danger and do all the possible preparations ahead of time. They should not underestimate the risks; therefore their preparedness could also be evaluated.

## p323 Grading Essays by Computer

### 1.
Overall, computer-aided grading does better job than average teachers; however the outcomes of using computerized systems would vary depending upon teachers skills. Also, my best teachers would use computer wisely as an efficiel tool.

### 2.
It would depend upon the policy that is imposed by school or teacher; however I believe students should have the right to challenge their grade and at least discuss it in person. Professor Belcher excels in clever use of technology. He is one of my best teachers.

### 3.
In case that the teacher is incompetent and unreliable, it would be a reasonable option for students to have; however, assuming that teachers are professional, I do not think it is necessary. Instead, students can discuss it with their teachers.

### 4.
That is out of the question if it is merely out of the teacher's laziness. That type of teacher should be reported. Students pay for receiving educational service. If everything is automated and the teacher does not do any teaching, why do students need to be there? There are plenty of excellent online courses out there.
