## [Right to privacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy)
- a human right and an element of various legal traditions which may restrain both government and private party action that threatens the privacy of individuals.[1][2] Over 150 national constitutions mention this right (click here to read the provisions).
- The Supreme Court has found that the Constitution implicitly grants a right to privacy against governmental intrusion. 
- Most states of the United States[who?]also grant a right to privacy and recognize four torts based on that right:
    1. Intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, or into private affairs;
    2. Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts;
    3. Publicity which places a person in a false light in the public eye; and
    4. Appropriation of name or likeness.

## [A Taxonomy of Privacy](https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/A_Taxonomy_of_Privacy)

"A Taxonomy of Privacy" is a work by Daniel J. Solove which attempts to order the different harms that may arise from infringements in privacy. Solove based this taxonomy on tort scholar William Prosser's work, who distinguished four different types of harmful activities under the privacy blanket:

- Intrusion upon the plaintiff’s seclusion or solitude, or into his private affairs.
- Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about the plaintiff.
- Publicity which places the plaintiff in a false light in the public eye.
- Appropriation, for the defendant’s advantage, of the plaintiff’s name or likeness.

### The taxonomy
- Information collection
    + Surveillance
    + Interrogation
- Information processing
    + Aggregation
    + Identification
    + Insecurity
    + Secondary use
    + Exclusion
- Dissemination of information
    + Breach of confidentiality
    + Disclosure
    + Exposure
    + Increased accessibility
    + Blackmail

    + Distortion
- Invasion
