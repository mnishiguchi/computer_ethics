## Trademarks

A trademark is a word, name, phrase, or symbol that identifies a product or service. In 1946, the Lanham Act, also referred to as the Trademark Act, was passed to provide protection for registered trademarks.23 To qualify for a trademark, the “mark” is supposed to be distinctive. Consider, for example, the distinctive apple that has come to symbolize Apple computers and devices. But not all trademarks have necessarily been distinctive in ways that one might assume to be relevant. As Halbert (1999) notes, for example, the trademark “uh-huh,” which is not very “distinctive,” was granted to Pepsi-Cola. Because of decisions such as this, critics have argued that trademark protections are being expanded in ways that are inappropriate. Consider the following example, which may support the view that some entrepreneurs have tried to expand the scope of trademark protection inappropriately. In the 1990s, America Online (AOL) applied for trademarks for its expressions “You’ve Got Mail,” “Buddy List,” and “IM” (Instant Messenger). If AOL had been allowed to own these trademarks, other ISPs that used these or very similar expressions could have been sued for infringing on AOL’s registered trademarks. So, in 2000, AT&T decided to challenge AOL. In this case, the court ruled that the expressions were not unique to AOL.

## Trade Secrets

A trade secret consists of information that is highly valuable and considered crucial in the operation of a business or other enterprise. The “secret” is accessible to only a few select individuals within the organization. Trade secrets can be used to protect formulas (such as the one used by Coca-Cola) and blueprints for future projects. They can also protect chemical compounds and processes used in manufacturing. Owners of a trade secret have exclusive rights to make use of it, but they have this right only as long as the secret is maintained.25 One problem with protecting trade secrets is that trade secret law is difficult to enforce at the international level. Not only have corporate spies in the United States tried to steal secrets from their corporate rivals, but there is evidence to suggest that international industrial espionage has become a growing industry. 

## Intellectual Property 

consists of objects that are not tangible. These nontangible, or intellectual, objects represent literary/creative works and inventions, which are the manifestations or expressions of ideas. Unlike tangible objects, which are exclusionary in nature, intellectual objects (e.g., software programs) are nonexclusionary: Consider once again Tom’s laptop computer, which is a physical object. If Tom is its sole owner, then Mary cannot own it, and vice versa. Tom’s laptop is an example of an exclusionary object. Next, consider a word processing program that resides in Tom’s computer. If Tom makes a copy of that program for Mary, then both Mary and Tom have copies of it. Thus, the word processing program is nonexclusionary. 

Note that scarcity (which often causes competition and rivalry when applied to physical objects) need not exist in the case of intellectual objects, which can be easily reproduced.  Note also that there are practical limitations to the number of physical objects one can own, and there are natural and political limitations to the amount of land that can be owned; however, countless digital copies of a software program can be produced and each at a relatively low cost. 

Another feature that distinguishes intellectual objects from physical objects has to do with exactly what it is that one can lay legal claim to. 
One cannot own an idea in the same sense that one can own a physical object; ideas themselves are not the kinds of things for which governments are willing to grant ownership rights to individuals. 

For a literary or artistic idea to be protected, it must be expressed (or “fixed”) in some tangible medium such as a physical book or a sheet of paper containing a musical score. If the idea is functional in nature, such as an invention, it must be expressed as a machine or a process. Whereas authors are granted copyright protections for expressions of their literary ideas, inventors are given an incentive, in the form of a patent protection, for expressions of their functional ideas. 
RFID Technology
RFID technology consists of a tag (microchip) and a reader. The tag has an electronic circuit, which stores data, and an antenna that broadcasts data by radio waves in response to a signal from a reader. The reader also contains an antenna that receives the radio signal, and it has a demodulator that transforms the analog radio information into suitable data for any computer processing that will be done.

When you look at a piece of information on the Internet, how do you decide whether or not it is trustworthy? Determining what’s true and what’s not has always been an issue. The branch of philosophy that studies this problem is called epistemology. Epistemology,  studies the nature of knowledge and how we know what we know.

Some people have legitimate jobs in which they are paid to break into systems by the people who own the systems. These people are sometimes called “white hat hackers;” their goal is to seek out vulnerabilities so they can be removed before a malicious intruder discovers them and launches an attack. 

## HACKER

Skilful programmers, usually refered to as intruders or hackers, can gain unauthorised access, or break-in, to computers and computer networks. Hackers can either act directly, by penetrating the system themselves, or indirectly, by embedding a destructive program within the system that causes serious damage or problems to the machine. 

The Oxford Dictionary of Computing defines hacking as ‘unauthorised access to computer material’.  A hacker is ‘a person who attempts to breach the security of a computer system by access from a remote point, especially by guessing or otherwise obtaining a password’. 

According to the second definition, which is regarded as the most original one, a hacker is ‘a person who had an instinctive knowledge enabling him or her to develop software apparently by trial and error’. In fact, based on the intentions of the computer intruder, there is a fundamental distinction between the two different personas: the hacker and the cracker. 

## CRACKER

For this reason, the term cracker was invented by hackers to defend their reputation. Whereas the term hacker does not always have a negative connotation and it can equally refer just to a skilful programmer who is obsessive about programming, the term cracker always has a negative meaning, and it is associated with a person who gains unauthorised access to a computer system for malicious purposes. 

PHREAKING
Another form of hacking is that of phreaking. Phreaking is a synthesis of the words ‘phone’, ‘free’, and ‘freak’ and is used to describe illegal access to telephone services and use of these services to satisfy the individual goals of the phreak. 
HACKTIVISM:
 The use of hacking for political purposes such as promoting a political cause or spreading anti-war messages via the Web.  Hacktivism is the use of hacking to promote a political cause.

 A distinction must be made between modern and old hackers. Where early hackers were gifted individuals who exercised their technical skills for self-esteem, intellectual From a historical viewpoint, Sara Baase observes three phases of hacking:
 firstly, the early years (1950s and 1960s), 
secondly, the middle period (1970s to the 1990s), and 
thirdly, the latest period (beginning of the 1990s). In the first phase, hacking had a positive connotation, whereas in the second it had a negative meaning. In the third phase, hacking is introduced to the Internet and cyberspace. 
Most popular hacking techniques 
Piggybacking: 
The hacker invades a computer system by pretending to be a legitimate user of the network. The hacker uses the user’s identification and password and logs into the network illegally.
 
## Scavenging
The hacker searches through stray data for clues that might unlock the secrets of a targeted computer system. A similar technique is known as dumpster diving, wherein the hacker searches electronic garbage in order to find discarded documentation that may include user names and passwords 

## Password guessing
Guessing the password may involve various techniques, such as dictionary attacks (searching with a dictionary file for words fitting to the password); hybrid attacks (adding numbers or symbols to the filename to successfully guess the password); brute force attacks (long-time guessing a password).
 Computer Sabotage 
Computer sabotage is one of the most dangerous forms of computer crime. The computer saboteurs create tiny but destructive programs that cause serious hardware and/or software problems in a computer system, such as deleting files in the hard disk, destabilising the computer system, clogging up mail servers by sending fake e-mails to the address found in the address book of the victim, and stealing information from the computer of the victim and sending this information back to the saboteur. There are different kinds of these malicious programs; the most popular are worms, viruses, bacteria, Trojan horses, logic bombs, time bombs, and spywares. As can be seen, the terminology of these programs is biological or military. This is not without purpose. Some of these programs such as the viruses and bacteria mimic in programmable form the behaviour of the living organisms after which they are named; others bring the destructive consequences of the war weapons which they represent electronically. 

## Viruses

a ‘computer virus’ is a self-replicating program reproduced by attaching executable copies of itself to other programs. The effects of a virus may range from irritating messages to complete destruction of the system. A virus cannot run independently. Initially, the virus requires a host program to infect, and it is not executed until the host program is run. A virus can spread rapidly through hosts that share the same infected programs or disks that include these programs. A computer virus is very difficult for the common user to detect. Most viruses use sophisticated techniques both to infect the system and to avoid detection. 
The most common type of viruses are: 
(1) boot sector viruses: infects the system boot and spreads whenever the system is loaded; 
(2) e-mail viruses: spread through e-mail attachments; and 
(3) macro viruses: spread through documents that contain macros—programming instructions that perform automated tasks. 

## Worms

A worm is a virus-like program that makes copies of itself across network connections, seeking uninfected workstations in which to reproduce. In contrast to a computer virus, a worm program can travel independently through different hosts and resides more in the computer memory of a system rather than on disk. The aim of a typical worm is through continued reproductions to cause disk or memory overload throughout the network. Inevitably, the network freezes and the system has to be reloaded; this process causes complete loss of memory data that have not been saved on disk. On the other hand, the consequences of a worm are not as destructive as that of a virus. A worm is a memory virus; thus it can be removed by shutting down the infected system. 

## Trojan horse

a destructive program disguised to appear as something benign. The name of this malicious program comes from the famous wooden horse of the Trojan War that the Greeks left as a gift to the Trojans. The horse was full of Greek armed forces that caused the fall of Troy when released into the city at the right moment. Likewise, the electronic version of the Trojan horse resides in the code of a program until the moment of its activation. The conditions of activation are determined by the computer programmer who designed the program. A Trojan horse is usually posted through the Internet disguised as a harmless program, game, or utility. Trojan horses are also used to exchange secret information between hackers. Some Trojan horses release other malicious programs such as viruses or worms. 

## Logic Bombs and Time Bombs

Logic Bombs and Time Bombs are kinds of Trojan horses. A Logic Bomb inserts secretly into a system and causes a destructive action when a certain logical event or a sequence of events happens (e.g., if program x runs, then do destructive action y). Similarly, a Time Bomb is triggered after a particular time-related event (e.g., if program x runs after date y, then do the destructive action z). Frequently, a logic bomb or a time bomb is an act of vengeance. For example, a programmer who is unfairly removed from his or her post may plant a time bomb to be triggered after the date of his or her removal. 

## Spyware

A spyware is a type of surveillance program that is inserted into a computer system in order to monitor, store, and analyse the electronic transmissions of the system. A spyware is not itself a destructive program. In some cases, spywares are used for security reasons. However, it must be mentioned that the risk of infection is increased if the user opens e-mail attachments from unknown senders, downloads unauthorised software, uses discs from different computers, and does not follow regular security measures. The user can be alerted to the presence of a destructive program by annoying messages on the screen, strange behaviour of the system, problems in system performance, or partial destruction of data. In this case, the user is recommended to use a vaccine or disinfectant utility (also called an anti-virus utility) that searches for malicious programs throughout the system, informs the user about possible infections, and usually cleans the infected files from the destructive code. The user is also able to select a safeguard option of the program that protects the system from unexpected virus attacks on-line. This option helps the user monitor all suspicious virus-like activities. Most anti-virus programs download new updates on-line as new viruses appear. Thus, in order to be effective, an anti-virus program must be frequently updated with the new virus-fighting database and, if there is network, must be installed in all network nodes. 

Alongside the anti-virus programs some additional actions are suggested in order to minimise the risks of infection: 

1. Make sure all purchased software comes in sealed, tamper-proof packages. 
2. Be careful about software received from friends, as well as files downloaded from bulletin boards, the Web, e-mail attachments, and other forms of shareware and freeware programs.
 3. Be particularly careful with software of unknown origin.
 4. Avoid using disks from the office computer at the home computer and vice versa. 
5. Make backup copies of software and data. With regard to making backups, it is important that the user follows a systematic procedure of backups and security. This procedure is known as good practice and includes: (1) regular file saves while working; (2) frequent backups of computer data; and (3) system protection. Good practice aims to improve the security of the computer system and protect programs and data in case of destructions, misuses, and malfunctions. The backup copies must be kept in different versions by following a historical timeline. If a recent version is corrupted, the user must be able to retrieve data from an earlier version. Once backup copies have been made, they should also be protected and stored in a secure location away from the originals.

Moreover, in 1990, the British Parliament passed the Computer Misuse Act (CMA). CMA divides computer misuse offences into three categories:
1. Unauthorised access to computer material
2. Unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences
3. Unauthorised modification of computer material 

## Privacy Laws and Data Protection Principles 

Many nations, especially in the West, have enacted strong privacy legislation. The United States, however, has not taken the lead on legislation initiatives in this area; in fact, some would argue that the United States is woefully behind Canada and the European nations when it comes to protecting its citizens’ privacy. 

For example, in the United States, there is currently very little privacy protection provided in legal statutes. In 1974, Congress passed the Privacy Act, which has been criticized both for containing far too many loopholes and for lacking adequate provisions for enforcement. Also, it applies only to records in federal agencies and thus is not applicable in the private sector. Critics also point out that there is virtually no explicit legal protection for private e-mail communications in the United States. 

Julian Sanchez notes that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986, which was “tweaked in the early 1990s,” was written before most people had even heard of the Internet. Some U.S. citizens might assume that the Fourth Amendment (prohibiting government search and seizure) also applies to the protection of e-mail communications. However, Sanchez points out that it was not until 2010 that a court in the United States finally ruled in favor of privacy protection for an e-mail communication—and he notes that this ruling was handed down only at the circuit court level of one federal court. 

In 2003, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which provides protection for “individually identifiable” medical records from “inappropriate use and disclosure,” was enacted into law in the United States. But the kind of privacy protection provided by HIPAA does not apply to an individual’s nonmedical/health records such as consumer data, or even to one’s genetic data. 

However, critics argue that privacy legislation in the United States has resulted mostly in a “patchwork” of individual state and federal laws that are neither systematic nor coherent. Generally, U.S. lawmakers have resisted requests from privacy advocates and consumer groups for stronger consumer privacy laws. Instead, they have sided with business interests in the private sector, who believe that such legislation would undermine economic efficiency and thus adversely impact the overall economy. Critics point out, however, that many American businesses that have subsidiary companies or separate business operations in countries with strong privacy laws and regulations, such as nations in Western Europe, have found little difficulty in complying with the privacy laws of the host countries; furthermore, profits for those American-owned companies have not suffered because of their compliance. 

The most foolproof solution to this problem is biometrics—digitising individual’s biological characteristics such as fingerprints, voices, veins on the back of the hand, patterns of blood vessels in the retina, wheel patterns of the iris, and lip prints.

## Data mining

the compiling of masses of data into one or more databases in order to extract new information and knowledge that were previously hidden and/or unidentified. The technique is also known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). Data mining usually involves artificial intelligence, neural networks, and machine induction combined with statistics and data analysis. It is used in direct marketing, allowing marketers to combine various criteria taken from databases to focus on a specific target group. Data mining is also used by commercial companies to discover patterns of behaviour for consumers’ preferences and activities. For instance, a credit card company can extract various data from divergent databases to determine how customers have spent their money.

## Virtual Reality 

Virtual reality (VR) is the digital simulation of an external reality. It is defined as ‘the creation and experience of environments’.1 VR is the result of computer simulations in which a series of abstract models are connected to develop an artificial environment that emulates real-world conditions in digital form (usually in 3D graphics and interface). 

The result is that the perceptible world is an illusionary reality. Likewise, in the computerised virtual world, users are able to interact with other users via avatars—3D graphical representations of the participants . The VR illusion is produced by providing perceptual feedback to the system, such as vision, hearing, movement, and smell. Virtual reality participants use specialised VR equipment, such as data gloves (input devices worn on users’ hands) and headsets (I/O devices worn on users’ heads). The benefits of virtual reality are beyond doubt. Where working in physical, real-life prototypes is dangerous, expensive, time-consuming, and non-replicable, yielding unpredictable results, virtual reality and computer simulations offer the security of artificial environments, inexpensive production of digital models, projection and visualisation of possible future conditions, and replication of real-life states in digital form. This ability to replicate real life is particularly useful for scientific research in which trial-and-error techniques are used to justify an experiment or to test a product. However, the disadvantages of computer modelling are equally important. 

## The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) of 1998

 aimed to protect children from commercial Websites with pornographic material. COPA was blocked by the courts and has never taken effect. The Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) of 1996 extended the existing federal criminal laws against child pornography to the Internet and new computer media.13 CPPA defines child pornography in a broad sense: ‘child pornography’ means any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, drawing, or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where— 

(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; 
(B) such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or 
(C) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. 

However, child pornography is a complex issue in the European Union because child protection systems and the evaluation of data are different in member states. Nevertheless, some movements have been made in this direction. 
This solution can be realised with automated content control technologies, such as filtering software and rating systems, known as PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection).16 Filtering software compares given keywords and names with prohibited Internet addresses and blocks access to unaccepted Websites. PICS enables labels (metadata) to be associated with Internet content and controls access to unwanted Websites. A label is embedded either by content providers or independent organisations. Internet users rely on these labels to prohibit access to unwanted Websites. However, in both technologies there are serious reliability problems. 

Censorship may become disadvantageous to children’s critical development. It may also lead to the opposite result: obscene pornography could become more desirable due to prohibition. censorship is not in accordance with the human rights of freedom and equality. If Internet sources and services are going to be unfairly controlled by ISPs, governments, parents, or other authorities, then the freedom of speech, pluralism, and the free flow of ideas could also be endangered. Here lies the problem of what is considered pornographic. 

## Electronic Business Electronic business,3 or e-business

refers to the use of computers (computer networks, telecommunications, and electronic data) for ‘performing and co-coordinating critical business processes such as designing products, obtaining supplies, manufacturing, selling, fulfilling orders and providing services’. Evolving areas of e-business are e-banking, e-marketing, and e-commerce. 

## Electronic commerce, or e-commerce

the use of information and communication technologies for marketing, buying, and selling products and services. Through e-commerce, small and large companies, various individuals, and groups are able to market and advertise their products and services worldwide (particularly via the Internet) and actually increase profits by reducing sales, advertising, stock, and operational costs (for instance, tax rates and traveling costs). 

## Artificial Intelligence 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as the discipline concerned ‘with the building of computer programs that perform tasks requiring intelligence when done by humans’.AI consists of two branches of research: the first aims to explore the nature of human intelligence by simulating it; the second aims to build integrated systems that demonstrate intelligent behavior. While the first branch aims to supplement human intelligence, especially the human abilities of learning, reasoning, and decision making, the second branch aims to create expert systems without any resemblance to human intelligence.

## Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

CFAA covers areas over which the federal government has jurisdiction: government computers, financial systems, and computers used in interstate or international commerce or communication. That,includes computers connected to the Internet, cellphone systems, and so on. Under the CFAA, it is illegal to access a computer without authorization or to exceed one’s authorization. The CFAA is the main antihacking law, but prosecutors also use other federal laws to prosecute people for crimes related to computer and telecommunications systems.
