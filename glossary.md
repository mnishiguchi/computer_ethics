## Virtual Reality

Virtual reality (VR) is the digital simulation of an external reality. It is defined as ‘the creation and experience of environments’.1 VR is the result of computer simulations in which a series of abstract models are connected to develop an artificial environment that emulates real-world conditions in digital form (usually in 3D graphics and interface).

The result is that the perceptible world is an illusionary reality. Likewise, in the computerised virtual world, users are able to interact with other users via avatars—3D graphical representations of the participants . The VR illusion is produced by providing perceptual feedback to the system, such as vision, hearing, movement, and smell. Virtual reality participants use specialised VR equipment, such as data gloves (input devices worn on users’ hands) and headsets (I/O devices worn on users’ heads). The benefits of virtual reality are beyond doubt. Where working in physical, real-life prototypes is dangerous, expensive, time-consuming, and non-replicable, yielding unpredictable results, virtual reality and computer simulations offer the security of artificial environments, inexpensive production of digital models, projection and visualisation of possible future conditions, and replication of real-life states in digital form. This ability to replicate real life is particularly useful for scientific research in which trial-and-error techniques are used to justify an experiment or to test a product. However, the disadvantages of computer modelling are equally important.

## Electronic Business Electronic business,3 or e-business

refers to the use of computers (computer networks, telecommunications, and electronic data) for ‘performing and co-coordinating critical business processes such as designing products, obtaining supplies, manufacturing, selling, fulfilling orders and providing services’. Evolving areas of e-business are e-banking, e-marketing, and e-commerce.

## Electronic commerce, or e-commerce

the use of information and communication technologies for marketing, buying, and selling products and services. Through e-commerce, small and large companies, various individuals, and groups are able to market and advertise their products and services worldwide (particularly via the Internet) and actually increase profits by reducing sales, advertising, stock, and operational costs (for instance, tax rates and traveling costs).

## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as the discipline concerned ‘with the building of computer programs that perform tasks requiring intelligence when done by humans’.AI consists of two branches of research: the first aims to explore the nature of human intelligence by simulating it; the second aims to build integrated systems that demonstrate intelligent behavior. While the first branch aims to supplement human intelligence, especially the human abilities of learning, reasoning, and decision making, the second branch aims to create expert systems without any resemblance to human intelligence.

## Internet filtering / Internet censorship

- The control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the Internet.
- Disadvantages: They can block too much content, keeping users from accessing useful information

## [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)
- the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video

## Therac-25 and the Ariane 5 rocket
One of the sources of failure common to BOTH the Therac-25 and the Ariane 5 rocket was **reuse of software from previous versions of the systems**.

## Digital watermarking
- What is embedding small errors into a digital image so that someone viewing the image cannot see the errors with the naked eye, but a special computer program can use the errors to identify the source of the image.

---

## Net Neutrality
-  a principle that says neither Internet service providers nor governments should impose any restrictions on a user’s access to networks that participate in the Internet because of the legal content of the information transferred, computing platform, point of origin, or point of destination

## QR code
- sort of 2-dimensional bar code that can be read by camera phones and computers
