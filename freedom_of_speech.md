# Freedom of speach

The First Amendment does not protect:
- Hate Speech
- Inciting Violence
- Supporting Terrorism
- Public Employee Speech
- Defamation
- Obscene Speech
- Intellectual Property
- True Threats
    + The category of "true threat" is narrow because government has often used the idea of "threat" as an excuse to punish dissenters, whose speech is often exaggerated and inflammatory.


## Defamation
An oral or written statement of alleged fact that is false and that harms another person is.

- Libel is a **written** defamatory statement
- Slander is a **spoken or oral** defamatory statement.
