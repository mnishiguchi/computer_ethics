# Laws

## [CAN-SPAM Act of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003)
- the United States' first national standards for the sending of commercial e-mail
- requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce its provisions

## [Strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation)
- A lawsuit that is intended to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition. Such lawsuits have been made illegal in many jurisdictions on the grounds that they impede freedom of speech.

## [Communications decency act (CDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act)
- also known by some legislators as the "Great Internet Sex Panic of 1995"
- the first notable attempt by the US Congress to regulate pornographic material on the Internet.

## Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)

CFAA covers areas over which the federal government has jurisdiction: government computers, financial systems, and computers used in interstate or international commerce or communication. That,includes computers connected to the Internet, cellphone systems, and so on. Under the CFAA, it is illegal to access a computer without authorization or to exceed one’s authorization. The CFAA is the main antihacking law, but prosecutors also use other federal laws to prosecute people for crimes related to computer and telecommunications systems.

## The Child Online Protection Act (COPA) of 1998

- Protects children from harmful material on the Internet; however, it was **ruled unconstitutional** and  **never took effect**.
- aimed to protect children from commercial Websites with pornographic material. COPA was blocked by the courts and has never taken effect. The Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) of 1996 extended the existing federal criminal laws against child pornography to the Internet and new computer media.13 CPPA defines child pornography in a broad sense: ‘child pornography’ means any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, drawing, or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where:

(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;
(B) such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or
(C) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

However, child pornography is a complex issue in the European Union because child protection systems and the evaluation of data are different in member states. Nevertheless, some movements have been made in this direction.
This solution can be realised with automated content control technologies, such as filtering software and rating systems, known as PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection).16 Filtering software compares given keywords and names with prohibited Internet addresses and blocks access to unaccepted Websites. PICS enables labels (metadata) to be associated with Internet content and controls access to unwanted Websites. A label is embedded either by content providers or independent organisations. Internet users rely on these labels to prohibit access to unwanted Websites. However, in both technologies there are serious reliability problems.

Censorship may become disadvantageous to children’s critical development. It may also lead to the opposite result: obscene pornography could become more desirable due to prohibition. censorship is not in accordance with the human rights of freedom and equality. If Internet sources and services are going to be unfairly controlled by ISPs, governments, parents, or other authorities, then the freedom of speech, pluralism, and the free flow of ideas could also be endangered. Here lies the problem of what is considered pornographic.

## [Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA)](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act)
- to address concerns about children's access to obscene or harmful content over the Internet.
- imposes certain requirements on schools or libraries that receive discounts for Internet access or internal connections through the E-rate program.
- requires federally financed schools to use some form of technological protection to block computer access to obscene material.

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA)
- Imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.
