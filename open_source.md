# Open source

- An alternative way of distributing software.
- Licenses for open-source programs have the following key characteristics:

  1. No restrictions preventing others from selling or giving away the software.
  2. The source code to the program must be included in the distribution or easily available by other means (such as downloadable from the Internet).
  3. No restrictions preventing people form modifying the source code and derived works can be distributed according to the same license terms as the original program.
  4. No restrictions regarding how people can use the software.
  5. These rights apply to everyone receiving re-distributions of the software without the need for additional licensing agreement.
  6. The license cannot put restrictions on other software that is part of the same distribution. For example, a program's open-source license cannot require all of the other programs on the CD to be open-source.

Note that there is nothing in these guidelines that says an open-source program must be given away for free.
