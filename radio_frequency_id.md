# Radio-frequency identification (RFID)
- **Uses electromagnetic fields** to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.

### RFID tags
- Small devices that contain an electronic chip and an antenna. The chip stores identification data (and possibly other data) and controls operation of the tag. The antenna transmits and receives radio signals for communicating with devices that read the tag.
- Used in many industries, for example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line; RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses; and implanting RFID microchips in livestock and pets allows positive identification of animals.

#### Advantages
- The read/write capability of an active RFID system enables the use of interactive applications.
- The tags can be read from a distance and through a variety of substances such as snow, fog, ice, or paint, where barcodes have proved useless.

#### Disadvantages
- Unlike barcodes, RFID chips make it possible to identify someone or something at a considerable distance from the reader.
- Another way to sacrifice your privacy, inadvertently or not, is through the use of OnStar. 
- If Uncle Sam (the IRS, FBI, or CIA) wanted to follow you around, the OnStar system would be the handiest tool to use.
