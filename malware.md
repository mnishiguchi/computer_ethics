- [What Is the Difference: Viruses, Worms, Trojans, and Bots?](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/virus-differences.html#5)

### Rootkit
- A collection of computer software typically malicious.
- Designed to enable access to a computer or areas of its software that would not otherwise be allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) while at the same time masking its existence or the existence of other software.

### Virus
- A small program written to alter the way a computer operates, without the permission or knowledge of the user.
- A virus must meet two criteria:
    1. It must **execute itself**. It will often place its own code in the path of execution of another program.
    2. It must **replicate itself**. For example, it may replace other executable files with a copy of the virus infected file. Viruses can infect desktop computers and network servers alike.

### Trojan Horse
- Files that claim to be something desirable but, in fact, are malicious. 
- Do not replicate themselves, as viruses do.
- Contain malicious code, that, when triggered, cause loss, or even theft, of data.

### worm
- Programs that replicate themselves from system to system without the use of a host file. 
- Although worms generally exist inside of other files, often Word or Excel documents, there is a difference between how worms and viruses use the host file.
