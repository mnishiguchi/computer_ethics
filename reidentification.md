## [Re-identification](https://epic.org/privacy/reidentification/)

- Identifying the individual from a set of anonymous data
-  the process by which anonymized personal data is matched with its true owner. In order to protect the privacy interests of consumers, personal identifiers, such as name and social security number, are often removed from databases containing sensitive information.

- e.g., Journalists and acquaintances identified people in small communities 
    + Search on numerous specific topics, such as the cars they own, the sports teams they follow, their health problems, and their hobbies.
- e.g., Search query data (p51)

    + Search engines collect many terabytes of data daily.
    + The companies analyze the data to improve search services, to target advertising better, and to develop new services.
    + By analyzing search queries, companies draw conclusions about what kinds of products and features people are looking for. They modify their products to meet consumer preferences.
    + In 2006, the federal government presented Google with a subpoena for two months of user search queries and all the Web addresses that Google indexes. Google protested, bringing the issue to public attention. Although the subpoena did not ask for names of users, the idea of the government gaining access to the details of people’s searches horrified privacy advocates and many people who use search engines. Google and privacy advocates opposed the precedent of government access to large masses of such data. A court reduced the scope of the subpoena, removing user queries.

- e.g., Smartphones (p53)
    - send location data to Google and Apple
    - sent age and gender in- formation to advertising companies
    - various apps copy the user’s contact list to remote servers
    - bank account numbers and security access codes in a hidden file on the user’s phone
    - **Some issues**:
        - Our contact lists and photos are ours; we should have control of them.
        - Law enforcement blindly relies on sometime flawed data.

- e.g., Data mining (p58)
    + searching and analyzing masses of data to find patterns and develop new information or knowledge.
    + e.g., research using social network data and smartphone data
- e.g., Opt in vs Opt out (p59)
- e.g., National ID system
