# Whistle-Blowing

## Definition
- No “standard” or universally agreed-upon definition of this controversial activity.

### John Boatright
- the voluntary release of nonpublic information, as a moral protest, by a member or former member of an organization outside the channels of communication to an appropriate audience about illegal and/or immoral conduct in the organization that is opposed in some significant way to the public interest
- identifies three key requirements regarding the nature of the information revealed in a whistle-blowing act:
    + the information must be Nonpublic Voluntarily disclosed by a member, or former member, of an organization Presented to an “appropriate” audience
    + the information revealed to the appropriate source is about conduct deemed to be:
        * illegal and/or immoral in nature and
        * harmful to the general public (if not revealed)
 
### Luegenbiehl
- “open” whistle-blowing vs “anonymous” whistle-blowing

### De George
- Internal vs. external
- Personal vs. impersonal
- Governmental vs. nongovernmental.

### Bok
- an individual who makes “revelations meant to call attention to negligence, abuses, or dangers that threaten the public interest.
- an individual who makes public their disagreement with their employers or with some authority, their activities can be viewed as a form of “dissent.”

### Brenkert
- the whistle-blower’s act of (voluntary) disclosure or revelation must also be deliberate (not accidental)

## Criteria for Blowing the Whistle

- [Criteria for Blowing the Whistle 
In an Engineering Context](http://www.richardcheeks.com/professor/DeGeorge-x.htm)

### De George’s Model for Evaluating Whistle-Blowing
- De George proposes a series of conditions for determining when an employee is 
    + morally permitted to blow the whistle and
    + morally obligated to do so.
- He believes that employees are morally permitted to go public with information about the safety of a product, or a policy, when three key conditions are satisfied. 
- We should also note that De George intends his model to be applied in nongovernmental cases of whistle-blowing

### De George’s three conditions (summary)
#### 1. The “policy” will do “serious and considerable harm” to the public.

#### 2. The employee(s) have reported the “serious threat” to their immediate supervisor and have made “their moral concern known.”

#### 3. The employee(s) have exhausted the “internal procedures and possibilities” within the organization, including going to the board of directors, if necessary.
 
### Two additional conditions
 
#### 4. The employee(s) have “accessible, documented evidence that would convince a reasonable, impartial, observer that one’s view of the situation is correct.”

#### 5. The employee(s) have “good reasons to believe that by going public the necessary changes will be brought about.”

## Cases
- [List of whistleblowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_whistleblowers)
- [Case: The Ford Pinto](https://philosophia.uncg.edu/phi361-matteson/module-1-why-does-business-need-ethics/case-the-ford-pinto/)
    + Ford knew that the Pinto represented a serious fire hazard when struck from the rear, even in low-speed collisions. Ford officials faced a decision. Should they go ahead with the existing design, thereby meeting the production timetable but possibly jeopardizing consumer safety? Or should they delay production of the Pinto by redesigning the gas tank to make it safer and thus concede another year of subcompact dominance to foreign companies? Ford not only pushed ahead with the original design but stuck to it for the next six years.

## Exercises

- Evaluate Richard De George’s criteria for any whistle- blowing case you find from online search.
    1. Explain the whistle-blowing case and provide link to it.
    2. Explain the answers of applying each of Richard De George’s criteria each of the criteria to the case. You need to cite all sources used.
- Your case can be morally permissible and/or morally required.
