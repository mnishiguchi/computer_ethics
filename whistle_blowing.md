# Whistle-Blowing

## Definition
- No "standard" or universally agreed-upon definition of this controversial activity.

### John Boatright
- the voluntary release of nonpublic information, as a moral protest, by a member or former member of an organization outside the channels of communication to an appropriate audience about illegal and/or immoral conduct in the organization that is opposed in some significant way to the public interest
- identifies three key requirements regarding the nature of the information revealed in a whistle-blowing act:
    + the information must be Nonpublic Voluntarily disclosed by a member, or former member, of an organization Presented to an "appropriate" audience
    + the information revealed to the appropriate source is about conduct deemed to be:
        * illegal and/or immoral in nature and
        * harmful to the general public (if not revealed)
 
### Luegenbiehl
- "open" whistle-blowing vs "anonymous" whistle-blowing

### De George
- Internal vs. external
- Personal vs. impersonal
- Governmental vs. nongovernmental.

### Bok
- an individual who makes "revelations meant to call attention to negligence, abuses, or dangers that threaten the public interest.
- an individual who makes public their disagreement with their employers or with some authority, their activities can be viewed as a form of "dissent."

### Brenkert
- the whistle-blower’s act of (voluntary) disclosure or revelation must also be deliberate (not accidental)

## Criteria for Blowing the Whistle
- http://www.slideshare.net/guest4cf361/whistleblowing-presentation
- [Criteria for Blowing the Whistle 
In an Engineering Context](http://www.richardcheeks.com/professor/DeGeorge-x.htm)

### De George’s Model for Evaluating Whistle-Blowing
- De George proposes a series of conditions for determining when an employee is 
    + morally permitted to blow the whistle and
    + morally obligated to do so.
- He believes that employees are morally permitted to go public with information about the safety of a product, or a policy, when three key conditions are satisfied. 
- We should also note that De George intends his model to be applied in nongovernmental cases of whistle-blowing

### De George’s three conditions (summary)
#### 1. The "policy" will do "serious and considerable harm" to the public.

#### 2. The employee(s) have reported the "serious threat" to their immediate supervisor and have made "their moral concern known."

#### 3. The employee(s) have exhausted the "internal procedures and possibilities" within the organization, including going to the board of directors, if necessary.
 
### Two additional conditions
 
#### 4. The employee(s) have "accessible, documented evidence that would convince a reasonable, impartial, observer that one’s view of the situation is correct."

#### 5. The employee(s) have "good reasons to believe that by going public the necessary changes will be brought about."

## Cases
- [List of whistleblowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_whistleblowers)
- [Case: The Ford Pinto](https://philosophia.uncg.edu/phi361-matteson/module-1-why-does-business-need-ethics/case-the-ford-pinto/)
    + Ford knew that the Pinto represented a serious fire hazard when struck from the rear, even in low-speed collisions. Ford officials faced a decision. Should they go ahead with the existing design, thereby meeting the production timetable but possibly jeopardizing consumer safety? Or should they delay production of the Pinto by redesigning the gas tank to make it safer and thus concede another year of subcompact dominance to foreign companies? Ford not only pushed ahead with the original design but stuck to it for the next six years.

## Exercises

- Evaluate Richard De George’s criteria for any whistle-blowing case you find from online search.
    1. Explain the whistle-blowing case and provide link to it.
    2. Explain the answers of applying each of Richard De George’s criteria each of the criteria to the case. You need to cite all sources used.
- Your case can be morally permissible and/or morally required.

### Case: [Madoff Whistleblower: SEC Failed To Do The Math](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124208012)
This case can be considered as an external impersonal and nongovernmental whistle-blowing.

#### Summary
Markopolos realized Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme nearly a decade ago, when he was working as an options trader at a Boston financial firm that was losing customers to Madoff's more profitable strategy. His boss asked him to replicate Madoff's strategy, but Markopolos couldn't, because it wasn't real.

Harry Markopolos says his investigative team used publicly available information to uncover Madoff's scheme. Madoff's story, he says, was "so fanciful and far-fetched" that the SEC should have seen through it immediately.

#### 1. The "policy" will do "serious and considerable harm" to the public.
Yes, the investors were losing all the money that they invested in this Ponzi scheme.

#### 2. The employee(s) have reported the "serious threat" to their immediate supervisor and have made "their moral concern known."
Yes, he raised awareness of this Ponzi scheme from his employee up to Securities and Exchange Commssion(SEC).

#### 3. The employee(s) have exhausted the "internal procedures and possibilities" within the organization, including going to the board of directors, if necessary.
This criterion is technically not applicable because he did not belong to the Ponsi scheme organizer; however as an options trader, it can be said that he exhausted his available procedures within his employer to raise awareness of unethical and harmful operation of his competitor Madoff.

#### 4. The employee(s) have "accessible, documented evidence that would convince a reasonable, impartial, observer that one’s view of the situation is correct."
Yes, Markopolos says his investigative team used publicly available information to uncover Madoff's scheme.

#### 5. The employee(s) have "good reasons to believe that by going public the necessary changes will be brought about."
Yes. Otherwise all the investors of Madoff's scheme would lose all the money they invested in the scheme.

### [Case: The Ford Pinto](https://philosophia.uncg.edu/phi361-matteson/module-1-why-does-business-need-ethics/case-the-ford-pinto/)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Copp
- This case can be considered as an internal impersonal and nongovernmental whistle-blowing.

#### Summary
To save time rear-end collision testing was not undertaken until after launch, although Ford engineers knew that testing for rear-end impact was a standard safety procedure.

Ford made a decision not to spend $11 per car to redesign the Pinto to prevent its gas tank from exploding. 

Ford sold the car for years knowing that it contained a critical defect 

Copp, a veteran car designer of the Ford Motor Company, disagreed with the production of the Ford Pinto once the well documented safety problems were known. Copp resultantly resigned from Ford, and his subsequent articles and critic was successfully taken up by Ralph Nader.

#### 1. The "policy" will do "serious and considerable harm" to the public.
Yes, it will expose the drivers of that model to serious danger in case of collision.

#### 2. The employee(s) have reported the "serious threat" to their immediate supervisor and have made "their moral concern known."
Yes, he did. As a car designer, he knew there was a flaw in Pinto's design.

#### 3. The employee(s) have exhausted the "internal procedures and possibilities" within the organization, including going to the board of directors, if necessary.
Yes, he did and he ended up resigning because Ford made a decision to hide from public the possible risk of Pinto's gas tank from exploding instead of redesign the Pinto to prevent its gas tank from exploding.

#### 4. The employee(s) have "accessible, documented evidence that would convince a reasonable, impartial, observer that one’s view of the situation is correct."
Ford actually performed crash-test that was a safety standard proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the result was ruptured gas tanks and dangerous leaks. Unless Ford destroy all the evidence, it can be said that accessible documented evidence was present.

#### 5. The employee(s) have "good reasons to believe that by going public the necessary changes will be brought about."
Yes. it will expose the drivers of that model to serious danger in case of collision.
